            Hi! My name is Indy. I'm a programmer from Thailand. I mainly use Unity for game development and Python for my personal projects, which are a Discord bot and Snake AI.

            I love to play many puzzle games, such as The Witness, Portal, Kami 2, while True: learn() as it make me feel good when I solve something difficult and challenging.
            I also watch Japanese anime and read manga since they are entertaining and make me stay sharp and imaginative.
